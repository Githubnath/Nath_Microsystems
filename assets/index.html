        <h2>Our Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Here are some of our work

	1. Project Tittle: Fitness Tracker

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) - stack app for tracking daily exercises.
It is a user-friendly application that enables individuals to easily track and manage their daily fitness routines.
Key features include:
logging and tracking of both cardio and resistance exercises,
viewing of workout history,
ability to delete exercises

	2.     Personal Management System
May 2023 - Jun 2023

Personal Management System (PMS) is a web-app tool designed to organize the essentials of everyday life, everything from a simple to-do list and notes to file organization. No more thinking about unhandled pending issues, no more sticky notes on the desk, or tons of files. No more searching for physical documents in folders. The application is simple, flexible and it’s designed for personal use.

PMS keeps control of schedules, notes, contacts, to-do and even manages documentations and images.

It has been designed to be clear and handy so that everything is organized and divided into the proper categories and subsections.

It's easier to understand this web application when you think about a Content Management System CMS (WordPress) or CRM (SugarCRM); the logic behind this system is very similar to those two. My Personal Management System (PMS) may offer fewer possibilities than those systems above, but it just does what I want it to do.

As a Software developer, I can categorically state that this brand is; Easy to use, Intuitive and user-friendly.

3  Fitness tracking API
Aug 2023 - Sep 2023

This is mainly a backend project.
It is a RESTful API for tracking workouts and exercises. It is a user-friendly API built with Django framework.

This API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints that allow users to track and manage their fitness-related data, such as creating and managing workouts, adding exercises to workouts, and tracking their progress over time.

By offering a standardized and efficient way to access and manage fitness data, the API will empower developers to create a wide range of fitness applications and services.
